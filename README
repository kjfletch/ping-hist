Provides ping logger (pinghist-record.py) and ping plotter (pinghist-plot.py).

pinghist-record.py
------------------

Performs ping operations on one or more targets and records the
results. The ideal way to run pinghist-record.py would be from a CRON
task or some other scheduler, but pinghist-record.py provides some
basic scheduling operations for simplicity and portability.

pinghist-record.py when called will ping the defined targets and log:

  + The raw output of the ping command appended to the end of the file
    <date>_<target>.txt

  + ping min, max, average and loss (%) from the command appended to
    the end of the comma-separated-values file
    <date>_<target>.csv

Usage
=====

pinghist-record.py [options] <target> [target ...]
  options:
    -e <delay>
    --every=<delay>
      Pause for <delay> between ping loop cycles. Delay can be specified
      in one of the following ways:
       - timespan in format HH:MM:SS, example: 01:45:00 for an hour and 45 minutes.
       - hours in the format <n>h, example: 11h for 11 hours.
       - minutes in the format <n>m, example: 10m for 10 minutes.
       - seconds in the format <n>s, example: 90s for 90 seconds. 

      Default: 15 minutes (00:15:00, 15m, etc).

    -f <duration>
    --for=<duration>
      Duration to continue the ping loop. This can be specified by:
       - The number of cycles <n> to loop for.
       - The keyword 'loop' to loop forever.
       - A timespan specified in the following ways:
         * timespan in format HH:MM:SS, example: 01:45:00 for an hour and 45 minutes.
         * hours in the format <n>h, example: 11h for 11 hours.
         * minutes in the format <n>m, example: 10m for 10 minutes.
         * seconds in the format <n>s, example: 90s for 90 seconds.

      Default: 1 (1 iteration of the ping loop).

    -c <count>
    --packet-count=<count>
      Number of packets to send in each ping.

      Default: 30

    -q
    --quiet
      Turn on quiet mode. Notifications will not be written to standard out/error.

    -h
    --help
      Display this help.

    target (targets)
      Targets to ping, example: www.bbc.co.uk.

Example
=======

python pinghist-record.py --packet-count=10 --every=10m --for=24h www.google.com www.bbc.co.uk

would ping both www.google.com and www.bbc.co.uk every 10 minutes for
24 hours with 10 packets.


pinghist-plot.py
----------------

Requires gnuplot. takes csv data from pinghist-record.py and plots it.
